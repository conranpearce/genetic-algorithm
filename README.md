# Genetic Algorithm

This repository includes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) implemented in Python, to solve optimisation problems.

* A report has also been included.
* This report contains background research about real life implementations of GAs, along with results of the GA.
* Experimentation around changing the fitness function and other characteristics of the GA to solve the optimisation problem has been documented and reviewed.
